# CMPUT 466 (Machine Learning) Class Project


This is a self-project completed by Alex Mak in CMPUT 466- Machine Learning at the University of Alberta. This project serves the aim to examine the training accuracies of various regression models when they are performing classification tasks. 

Project Background: 

* It was well known that linear regression performs poorly compared to logistic regression in classification tasks, therefore logistic regression models are preferred over linear regression models.  

* In order to avoid overfitting and reduce variance in linear regression models, the concept of regularization is introduced with the purpose of restricting the capacity of the linear regression modelsâ€™ hypothesis class so they will have a lower variance and a higher bias.

* Altogether, the task I would like to test is whether linear regression with regularization can perform as good as logistic regression in terms of the test performances on binary classification tasks. I will test this task through a training-validation-test infrastructure to train, validate and test different machine learning linear models
